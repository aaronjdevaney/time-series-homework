## ARMA Model 
The p-values in the ARMA model were greater than .05 which indicates that the ARMA model is not a good fit for the Yen data. I would not use this model.

## ARIMA Model
Similarly, the p-values in the ARIMA model were also greater than .05 which indicates that the ARIMA model is also not a good fit for the Yen data. I would not use this model either.

## Linear Regression Model
The Linear Regression Model appears to be underfitting the data because the in-sample RMSE is greater than the out-of-sample RMSE; however, the difference in the two RMSE numbers is fairly small indicating that it a good model.

## Conclusion
 Although it appears that the Linear Regression Model needs more data to make better predictions, it does appear to be a better fit for the YEN data than the ARMA or the ARIMA models. I would choose to rely on the Linear Regression Model if I were to invest in Yen futures contracts.
